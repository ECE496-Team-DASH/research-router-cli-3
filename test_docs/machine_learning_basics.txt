Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience without being explicitly programmed.

Key Concepts:
- Supervised Learning: Uses labeled training data to learn a mapping function from input to output
- Unsupervised Learning: Finds hidden patterns or structures in data without labeled examples  
- Reinforcement Learning: Learns through interaction with an environment using rewards and penalties

Common Algorithms:
- Linear Regression: Predicts continuous values
- Decision Trees: Makes decisions through a tree-like model
- Neural Networks: Mimics the structure and function of biological neural networks
- Support Vector Machines: Finds optimal boundaries between different classes

Applications:
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing and text analysis
- Recommendation systems
- Predictive analytics and forecasting
- Autonomous vehicles and robotics

Machine learning has revolutionized many industries by enabling computers to automatically learn and make decisions from data, leading to more intelligent and adaptive systems.
